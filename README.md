# **Blisstify**

## _Spotify custom playlist builder!_

#### This project is a React web application called Blisstify. Uses REST methedology to query the Spotify API and authorize the webapp with the user's account. Allows aforementioned users to build custom Spotify playlists through the adding of songs that come back from the Spotify database queries. Each track provides useful interface to add them to their playlist and remove them from it too. It also provides a handy 30 preview of the songs to make sure they are only adding the tracks that they intended to find. In the final steps, users can name their playlists whatever they like and save it directly to their account.
